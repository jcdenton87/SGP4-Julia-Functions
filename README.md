# SGP4-Julia-Functions
Port of the Vallado code from MatLab to Julia (clunky as it isn't optimized for Julia, just got it functioning)
Additional functions can be added, all of the functinality is rolled up into the SGP4 module...
***Note*** Don't forget to fix your directories if you're using this as mine aren't dynamic.
